Hi this is Che I want to make a collaborative book that would explain some of how it's possible to live for freedom eg, not use money or otherwise teach people I/we meet the hack-maker skilles of making things and how we DO. 

For ideas first off and some of the direction I am taking on this, yes, new paradigm, I recommend you go to my github first http://github.com/em-che

Can we, hack that? I remember there's a hackerspace passport, when I find I will submit here, and, probably make one :)
